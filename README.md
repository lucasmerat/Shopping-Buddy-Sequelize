## Description

*Shopping Budy* is a simple full-stack CRUD application with a Node/Express back-end and jQuery/Handlebars.js front-end. It uses mySQL as a database for persistent items and Materialize for design elements. The app allows users to add items to a working shopping list. Once they have gotten those items, they can add those items to a completed items list. They can easily re-add items they have in their completed list for frequently purchased items. They can also delete the item completely. 

This app was created for week 13 of UT Austin coding bootcamp. The focus of the unit was linking mySQL with a front-end application, and experimenting with Handlebars.js for templating.
